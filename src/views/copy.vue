                    Extract.pics is an easy to use tool that allows you to extract, view and download images from any
                    public website. Simply paste the URL of the website into the input field and click "Extract" to
                    start the process. After a few seconds you will see most or even all of the images found on the
                    website.

                  <span>
                    You can view the found images in a grid or list and explore them by <strong>sorting</strong> them by
                    name, type, dimensions, width, height or the actual file size. Additionally you can
                    <strong>search</strong> for images by their name, size or type/file format. This makes it really
                    easy to find exactly the images you need.

                    In case some images are very bright, you can <strong>switch to a dark background</strong> to make
                    them more visible. You can use the <strong>copy the URL</strong> of one or more images by clicking
                    the link icon or the <em>Copy selected URLs</em> button. You can also very easily
                    <strong>download</strong> indiviual images or <strong>multiple images</strong> at once by selecting
                    them and then downloading them all in a <strong>ZIP archive</strong>.

                    After the extraction process is finished you will find a list of all the images found on the website

                    <strong>This can take some time depending on how many images you selected.</strong> Note that there
                    is a chance that some images cannot be downloaded and won't be included in the ZIP file.

                <h4 class="mt-10 text-lg font-semibold mb-3">The extraction does not work. Why?</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed prose max-w-none">
                  <span>
                    There are several reasons why the extraction might fail. The website you entered might be not be
                    publicly accessible or it might be protected by a login. Very slow or large websites might also
                    cause issues.

                  <span>
                    And sometimes there are a lot of people using extract.pics at the same time which can cause
                    performance issues on our side. In this case you should try again later or try a different website.
                    We are continuously working on improving the performance of our service.

                  <span>
                    Sometimes other websites block the download of images from their website. In this case you can
                    right-click the images and press "Save image as..." or try to open the image in a new tab and
                    download it from there.

                  <span>
                    When trying to download multiple images at once, some images might not be included in the ZIP file,
                    because they could not be downloaded. In this case you can try to download them individually. If the
                    download does not work at all, please contact us.

                  <span>
                    Everytime you start the extraction process the website you entered is openend in a
                    <strong>Google Chrome</strong> browser. We then apply multiple different methods to find all the
                    images (and even SVG elements) on the website. After that the images are analyzed to show useful
                    information like type, name and size.

                  <span>
                    Yes. Every website is viewed just like you view them in your browser. We use the latest version of
                    the Google Chrome browser to process the websites you provide. After loading your website we execute
                    JavaScript and wait for any requests to finish before starting the extraction process.

                  <span>
                    After the server navigates to the website you provided, it <strong>scrolls down</strong> really fast
                    for a few seconds to find as many images as possible. Every image that the website loads in those
                    first ~10 seconds is then sent back to you. Tracking pixels and missing or invalid images are
                    automatically removed.

                <p class="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed prose max-w-none">
                  This can have several reasons. The most common is that the webserver, the image is stored on, does not
                  allow the image to be loaded/shown on other websites. If that is the case, we cannot display the image
                  on the page. However, it is very likely that you are still able to
                  <strong>download the image</strong>. If that fails too, try to
                  <strong>open the image in a new tab</strong>.
